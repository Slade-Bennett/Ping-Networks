# Ping-Networks

Ping-Networks is a PowerShell module that pings all hosts in specified networks from an Excel file and exports comprehensive results to Excel or CSV. It's designed to be a simple, efficient, and reliable tool for network administrators and engineers.

## Features

*   **Complete Network Scanning:** Calculates and pings ALL usable host addresses in each subnet (not just the first host).
*   **Universal CIDR Support:** Works with any standard CIDR notation (/8 through /30) - /24, /28, /16, etc.
*   **Accurate Subnet Calculations:** Uses bitwise operations for precise network address, broadcast address, and host range calculations.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Pings hosts concurrently using PowerShell background jobs for maximum speed (configurable batch size).
*   **DNS Resolution:** Automatically resolves hostnames for reachable hosts.
*   **Multiple Output Formats:**
    *   **Excel:** Color-coded results with summary statistics and per-network worksheets
    *   **HTML:** Interactive web reports with charts, sortable tables, and search functionality
    *   **JSON:** Structured data format ideal for APIs and programmatic processing
    *   **XML:** Hierarchical format compatible with most XML parsers and integration tools
    *   **CSV:** Simple tabular format for spreadsheet import
*   **Enhanced Progress Reporting:** Real-time scan statistics including ETA, scan rate (hosts/sec), and network progress.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Separated into reusable modules (subnet calculation, ping logic, Excel utilities, report generation).

## Requirements

*   PowerShell 5.0 or later.
*   Microsoft Excel installed.

## Usage

The main script `Ping-Networks.ps1` is located in the root directory. You can run it as follows:

```powershell
.\Ping-Networks.ps1 -InputPath '.\sample-data\NetworkData.xlsx' -Excel -Html
```

### Parameters

*   `InputPath`: (Required) The path to the input Excel file containing the network data. The file should have three columns: 'IP', 'SubnetMask', and 'CIDR'.
*   `OutputDirectory`: (Optional) The directory where all output files will be saved. Defaults to the user's Documents folder. All files use timestamped filenames (e.g., PingResults_20251224_235900.xlsx).
*   `Excel`: (Switch) Generate Excel output with color-coded results and summary statistics.
*   `Html`: (Switch) Generate interactive HTML report with charts and sortable tables.
*   `Json`: (Switch) Generate JSON output for programmatic consumption.
*   `Xml`: (Switch) Generate XML output for integration with other tools.
*   `Csv`: (Switch) Generate CSV output for simple tabular data.
*   `MaxPings`: (Optional) The maximum number of hosts to ping per network. If not specified, all usable hosts will be pinged.
*   `Timeout`: (Optional) The timeout in seconds for each ping. Default is 1 second.
*   `Retries`: (Optional) The number of retries for each ping. Default is 0.

**Note:** If no output format switches are specified, Excel output is generated by default for backward compatibility.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```powershell
.\Ping-Networks.ps1 -InputPath '.\sample-data\NetworkData.xlsx'
```

This will ping all the networks in the `NetworkData.xlsx` file and create a new Excel file in your Documents folder with the results (default behavior).

### Generate Multiple Formats

```powershell
.\Ping-Networks.ps1 -InputPath '.\sample-data\NetworkData.xlsx' -Excel -Html -Json
```

Generate Excel, HTML, and JSON reports simultaneously in the Documents folder. All files will have the same timestamp.

### Custom Output Directory

```powershell
.\Ping-Networks.ps1 -InputPath '.\sample-data\NetworkData.xlsx' -OutputDirectory 'C:\Reports' -Excel -Html
```

Create Excel and HTML reports in a custom directory (`C:\Reports`).

### Limit Hosts Per Network

```powershell
.\Ping-Networks.ps1 -InputPath '.\sample-data\NetworkData.xlsx' -Html -MaxPings 10
```

Generate HTML report scanning only the first 10 usable hosts in each network.

### All Output Formats

```powershell
.\Ping-Networks.ps1 -InputPath '.\sample-data\NetworkData.xlsx' -OutputDirectory 'C:\Reports' -Excel -Html -Json -Xml -Csv
```

Generate all available output formats in a custom directory from a single scan.

## Architecture

The project is organized into modular components for maintainability:

```

### Key Functions

*   **Get-UsableHosts:** Calculates all valid host IPs in a subnet using bitwise operations. Supports any CIDR from /8 to /30.
*   **Start-Ping:** Performs parallel ICMP pings using PowerShell background jobs with configurable batch sizes. Includes real-time progress tracking with ETA and scan rate calculations.
*   **Excel Utilities:** Suite of functions for COM automation (New-ExcelSession, Read-ExcelSheet, Write-ExcelSheet, etc.).
*   **Report Generation:**
    *   **Export-HtmlReport:** Creates interactive HTML reports with Chart.js visualizations, sortable tables, and search functionality
    *   **Export-JsonReport:** Generates structured JSON output with scan metadata and statistics
    *   **Export-XmlReport:** Produces well-formed XML documents using XmlWriter for proper formatting
